error #1 - centering divs
solution - specifying their fixed size

error #2 - form submission
solution - setting an 'addEventListener' for 'submit' and putting a callback function within it. inside the callback function, declare a new div which will contain
the other divs

error #3 - crossing out the specific divs created on click
adding their onclick functionality by using an anonymous function which makes a call to another separate function with the 'id' parameter. the id in this case is a
randomly generated number from 0 to 100.
