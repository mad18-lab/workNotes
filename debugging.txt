error #1 - centering divs
solution - specifying their fixed size

error #2 - form submission
solution - setting an 'addEventListener' for 'submit' and putting a callback function within it. inside the callback function, declare a new div which will contain
the other divs

error #3 - crossing out the specific divs created on click
adding their onclick functionality by using an anonymous function which makes a call to another separate function with the 'id' parameter. the id in this case is a
randomly generated number from 0 to 100.

fix #4 - added an alternative crossing out feature to tasks
in the onclick functionality of the tasks, first i verified whether the classlist contains linethrough or not. if yes, remove it. if not, add it.

fix #5 - added the edit functionality by adding an input form on click which takes in the specific div which needs to be updated as well as the content of the
already generated entry as parameters. in the onsubmit event listener of the form, update the values by query selecting the "p" elements in the div (there's only one)
and updating their text content with the input value.
